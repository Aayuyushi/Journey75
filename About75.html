            <h2>What is 75 Hard?</h2>
            <p>
                For those who aren't familiar, the 75-Hard is a 75-day plan created by motivational speaker, podcaster, author and 
                supplement company owner Andy Frisella back in 2019 as a <b>'transformative mental toughness program' </b>.<br><br>
                On his website, he writes: ‘75 HARD is the only program that can permanently change your life...from your way of thinking, 
                to the level of discipline you approach every single task in front of you with.’ The website also claims that more than 100,000 
                people have ‘completely changed their lives’ thanks to the programme. Sounds pretty impressive, right? <br><br>
                Truth be told, the challenge isn’t backed up by science (read on for an example), and many argue that the hardcore routine is 
                unsustainable, restrictive and potentially dangerous. It's only with access to and 24/7 guidance from the experts. Ideally, there 
                are no alterations allowed, but we are here to make it a little simpler.
            </p>

            <b>The 75 Hard Challenge RULES</b>
            <br><br>The 75 Hard Challenge is made up of six rules which have to be completed for 75 days straight. Skipping any one on any day 
            is ‘non-negotiable’.<br> The rules are as follows: <br>
            1. Stick to a diet, any diet for 75 days <br>
            2. Absolutely no alcohol or cheat meals are allowed (it doesn't specify what counts as a cheat meal, so you can set your rules ,but don’t cheat yourself)<br>
            3. Complete two 45-minute workouts or one 1hour 30 minutes workout each day without fail (try to include some outdoor activity for atleast 15 minutes)<br>
            4. Drink 3.5-4 litres of water every day for 75 days<br>
            5. Take a daily progress photo ( no, skipping it is not an option)<br>
            6. Read atleast 10 pages of inspirational, non-fiction each day (personal development, no audiobooks)

            <h2>Why 75 Hard?</h2>
            <p>
                Doing this challenge will give you a sense of direction and structure,’ Alex Parren, a nutritionist at Superzeros, tells us. ‘The rule about reading 
                non-fiction, for example, could encourage you to carve out time in your day to boost your knowledge as well as helping to reduce stress and screen time.’
            </p>
            <p>
                It could help develop healthy habits. Your fitness levels will certainly improve. Unlike other more prescriptive challenges, there’s an element of 
                choice with this 75 Hard Challenge as it is customisable.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Note</b><br>
                Anyone who thinks they might be triggered by implementing diet rules, rigid exercise habits and taking progress photos, should avoid this challenge. 
                If you’ve previously dealt with an eating disorder, body dysmorphia or exercise addiction, it most definitely isn’t for you.Those with existing injuries 
                or health conditions should consult a medical professional before embarking on the challenge.
